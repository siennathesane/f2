# f2: Community Intelligence for the People

## We're building the surveillance tools that corporations and governments don't want us to have.

**This is a community-owned cooperative.** No venture capital. No corporate surveillance. No selling your data. Just people building technology for people.

### What if communities had Palantir-level intelligence capabilities?

Right now, only corporations and intelligence agencies have access to sophisticated data analysis tools that can correlate information, identify patterns, and provide real-time intelligence. Meanwhile, our communities are left vulnerable‚Äîto ICE raids, environmental hazards, corporate exploitation, and systemic violence.

**We're changing that.**

f2 gives communities the analytical power to protect themselves, organize effectively, and fight back against systems designed to harm us.

### Real Community Protection, Right Now

**ICE Enforcement Tracking**: Real-time identification and coordination to protect our neighbors from detention and family separation.

**Community Safety Intelligence**: Know what's happening in your area without feeding police surveillance systems.

**Mutual Aid Coordination**: Connect resources, organize rapid response, and support each other when systems fail us.

**Investigative Tools**: Uncover corporate malfeasance, environmental crimes, and systemic injustices affecting your community.

**Open Source Intelligence**: Aggregate and analyze publicly available information to serve community interests rather than corporate profit.

### How We're Different

**Community-Owned**: One membership fee will provide 100% platform access, voting rights, and ownership stake‚Äîno tiered extraction models or premium features.

**Built for Liberation**: Designed by and for marginalized communities who need these tools most.

**No Corporate Bullshit**: No ads, no data mining, no enterprise sales, no government contracts.

**Open Source**: Code belongs to the community, not shareholders.

**Democratic Control**: Major decisions made through transparent, community-led processes with formal representation for different user communities.

### We're Doing This Scared (And That's Okay)

We know this is ambitious. We know it's dangerous to build tools this powerful. We know tech companies with billions of dollars and thousands of engineers have tried and failed to solve some of these problems.

**But our communities can't wait for perfect solutions.**

People are being detained right now. Families are being separated right now. Environmental disasters are happening right now. We need community intelligence infrastructure **right now**.

So we're launching our initiative with what we have, building with our communities, and improving together. Because the only thing scarier than building imperfect tools is leaving our communities defenseless.

### Become a Founding Member

**We're building the technology right now to earn your trust.**

Instead of asking for money upfront, we're developing the core platform with our own resources to prove this works. Once we have a working prototype that communities can actually use and find valuable, we'll launch a single community-driven fundraising round to sustain and scale the project.

**No corporate investors. No venture capital. Just one transparent ask to the communities we serve.**

**üí™ Technical Skills**: Help with development, security, design, or infrastructure. Rust, React Native, Supabase, Kubernetes, machine learning, and more - we need all kinds of expertise.

**ü§ù Community Organizing**: Connect us with community groups, help with user research, facilitate listening sessions, test early features.

**üìù Documentation & Legal**: Help with cooperative formation, policy development, grant writing, or documentation.

**üìß Early Access**: Get updates on development progress and be first to test new features as they're built.

**üéØ Founding Member Status**: Everyone who contributes meaningfully to the project through our fundraising round becomes a founding member with special recognition and advisory input as the cooperative grows.

### What We're Building Right Now

**Phase 1**: ICE tracking MVP, basic user management, and community listening sessions  
**Phase 2**: Community feedback systems and technical iteration  
**Phase 3**: Legal cooperative formation and democratic governance structure  
**Phase 4**: Single community-driven fundraising round 
**Phase 5**: Production deployment and mobile app launch  
**Phase 6**: Sustainable growth and expanded capabilities  

We're currently working through Phases 1-3 to build community trust and prove this technology works before asking for financial support.  

### Ready to Build Community Power?

This isn't just an app - it's infrastructure for liberation. Every founding member makes us stronger, more resilient, and helps us hold authority structures accountable to the communities they serve.

*"Technology is not neutral. We're either building tools for liberation or tools for oppression. We choose liberation."*
