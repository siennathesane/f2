# Paid vs Unpaid Work

Right now we are laser focused on getting this platform up and running. That requires a lot of unpaid work from contributors, yet many hands make light work.

We are grateful for any contributions efforts and hope to be able to offer paid opportunities in the future, both part-time and full-time. It is our intent to offer paid opportunities to those who have contributed significantly to the project.
