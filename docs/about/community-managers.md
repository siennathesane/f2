# Guiding the Community

Every community needs love and care to thrive. Community managers play a crucial role in fostering a positive and inclusive environment. It is a difficult role that requires empathy, patience, and a deep understanding of the community's needs. This role is not to be a gatekeeper or dictator of culture, but a guardrail to prevent toxic behavior and ensure a safe space for all members.
