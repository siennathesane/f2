# Keeping Us On Track üöê

This project has a lot of moving parts, and it's important to keep everyone on track. That's where project managers come in. They're responsible for coordinating the efforts of the team, ensuring that everyone is working towards the same goals, and making sure that the project stays on schedule.

We are trying to:

* Bootstrap a business
* Bootstrap an immensely difficult tech platform
* Launch a successful product
* Maintain healthy communications
* Coordinate with third parties interested in working with us
* Not drop the ball on anything

We need people who can keep us organized as we move as fast as we can.
