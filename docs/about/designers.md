# Shaping the Design

In addition to the technical aspects of the project, designers also play a crucial role in shaping the overall aesthetic and user experience. They will need to work closely with the developers to ensure that the final product is visually appealing, functional, and accessible.

## Design Principles

Here are some key principles that guide our design decisions:

- **User-Centered Design**: Prioritize user needs and preferences throughout the design process.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure the design is inclusive and usable by people with disabilities. Aim for Section 508 compliance.
- **Consistency**: Maintain a consistent visual and functional style across all components.
- **Simplicity**: Keep the design simple and intuitive to use.
- **Responsiveness**: Ensure the design adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.
- **Performance**: Optimize the design for fast loading times and smooth interactions.

## UI Framework

Currently we use Gluestack UI and Lucide iconography. Both should be available as Figma components.
