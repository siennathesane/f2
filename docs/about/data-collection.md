# Gathering Data

In order to make this platform work at the scale at which we need it to, we will need a large volume of data to be able to build & correlate effectively. This means that as a community, there are so many ways you can contribute without having to write code or participate in discussions. Types of data we will need:

* Names
* Email addresses
* Phone numbers
* Addresses
* Social media handles
* Website URLs
* Images
* Video recordings
* Audio recordings

When we are ready to begin publicly ingesting the data you are collecting, we will notify the community and you can then share it with us, either by uploading it to our platform or by providing us with a link to where it is hosted.
