# Communal Discussions

This type of technology is both dangerous and helpful and must be used responsibly. As part of that, we welcome meaningful discussion around use cases, bugs, limits, and other related topics. Currently the only two methods for these discussions are Discord and [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/siennathesane/f2/discussions). In time, we hope to add discussion features to the platform itself, where we can talk privately & securely as a community.
